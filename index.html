			<h2>Expertise</h2>
			<p>
				Even the best intentioned person without the right skills is bound to
				make a wrong decision. Accessibility and inclusion is at the core of our
				design of homes and institutions, research projects, educational plans,
				entertainment and leisure activities, healthcare practices, our world.
				Very few have specific training on accessibility and inclusion. I offer
				my life’s work and expertise to enable you and your immediate
				environment to be more accessible and inclusive. See below for some of
				my work;

			<h2>Offerings</h2>

			<h3>Disability and Elderly accessibility support</h3>
			<p>
				As people grow, our bodies are less agile and require more support in
				our daily life to avoid and limit the risk of injury. Persons with
				disabilities also need support in making our living spaces safer and
				more accessible. I will create a concept for an accessible environment
				tailored to your needs to make your living space, rented or owned, as
				barrier free as possible and maintain your agency and dignity.
			</p>

			<h3>Workplace and programmatic inclusion</h3>
			<p>
				I will assess the state of inclusion at your workplace, sensitivity of
				your staff and the people you serve. Then, I will design training for
				your team to elevate disability inclusion and acceptance and advise on
				implementation of feedback. I will offer technical support in inclusive
				project design in education, healthcare and Sexual Reproductive Health
				and Rights.
			</p>

			<h3>Inclusive education assessment and advising</h3>
			<p>
				I will design appropriate programs and training for your learning
				institution based on relevant educational and function assessment. This
				will cover the physical environment, specific educational needs of
				learners, guidance through educational transitions to families,
				designing Individualised educational plans and disability specific
				training to teachers and caregivers. I am a certified educational and
				functional assessor.

			<p>
				F. Njahîra Wangarî (She/Her/Hers) is a feminist scholar-activist,
				researcher and disability inclusion expert with muscular dystrophy
				committed to research and community work guided by disability justice,
				feminism and anti-ableism. I have worked for an extended time with
				diverse groups of people; teachers, families, learners, organisations,
				government entities, to make the world more inclusive and accessible. I
				am a graduate of Syracuse University’s Disability rights and Inclusive
				education Master’s program with additional training and research in
				inclusive education, disability law and inclusion in Kenya, Japan and
				South Africa. My experience spans across international non-profit,
				community organising, consulting and academia. As an advocate of
				disability justice principles, its principles are applicable in social
				justice, education, interdependence in community, governance and beyond.
				Alongside my lived experience of disability (muscular dystrophy) and
				layers of intersectional exclusions, my advocacy over many years extends
				across identities and continents. My love for teaching has placed me in
				classrooms with children at primary and secondary levels, undergraduate
				and postgraduate lecture rooms and in multiple training workshops with
				diversity in age, sexuality, race, disability and belief. I will help
				you to be more accessible and inclusive. Reach out by completing this
