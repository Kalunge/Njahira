					of Special Education (KISE) and a Master of Science in Teaching and

		<section class="more-about">
			<h2>More About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Njahira has been a guest lecturer in undergraduate and graduate
				classrooms on disability. Additionally, she has worked as the disability
				focal person in both local and international organisations with various
				levels of advising around education for learners.
			</p>

			<h2>Focus</h2>
			<p>
				Guiding/Supporting you as you make informed education and life decisions
				for your learner with and without disability.
			</p>

			<h2>Why</h2>
			<p>
				The current education system in the country can be challenging for
				families (by birth, adoption or by love) to navigate. Often times, the
				adults making decisions with regard to education are influenced and
				guided by their own past experiences in whatever education system they
				may have gone through as well as perceptions of what other systems may
				have been providing.
			</p>

			<h2>What</h2>
			<p>
				Coaching/advising allows you a space to examine the education options of
				the learner concerned with all the relevant information. It would
				involve provision of information about what should influence the
				education decisions of learners regardless of their age, genders,
				physical location while also taking into account these very variables.

			<h2 class="skill-header">Elders accessibility and support</h2>
			<p>
				As people age, their bodies are less agile and require more support in
				their daily life to avoid and limit the risk of injury. Often times,
				newly retired people are among those who might find themselves spending
				more time in their own homes than ever before. The risks of falls and
				need for additional movement support increase. This service aims to
				offer guidance and support to them and their loved ones as they navigate
				their environments in ageing bodies and maintain their agency and
				independence safely.
			</p>
			<h4>Depending on individual need, the services offered may include;</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>• Bathroom safety and comfort</li>
				<li>• Removing fall and injury risks at home</li>
				<li>• Accessibility and home modifications</li>
				<li>• Emergency planning and support</li>
				<li>• Footwear and back support (Gait support)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Sliding scale payment</h2>
			<p>
				At the heart of disability inclusion is disability justice. It is in
				acknowledging that injustices are present because of the racial,
				economic and societal setup of the communities we exist in. The ability
				to access information to support informed decision making in the
				education of a learner should not only be accessible to those who have
				access to finances. Rates vary depending on expected labour, time
				commitment, community being served, budget among other factors. Please
				share as much information as possible in the inquiry form below;
